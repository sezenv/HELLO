## **ABOUT**
I'm physician-scientist working in drug discovery. I want to make drug discovery more efficient and faster using computational tools. My research bridges the areas of systems biology, biophysics, medicinal chemistry and data science. I have expertise in structure- and ligand-based drug design including protein modelling, molecular dynamics, docking, chemoinformatics, machine learning, and data visualization. I apply and develop such methods to improve and accelerate the drug discovery process from the first step of target identification, all the way through to late lead optimization. My ongoing research focuses on creating integrative application pipelines that convert complex data into simple logical stories. I generate testable hypotheses, design & execute computational experiments, provide in-depth analysis and interpretation of results, and translate them into new, small molecule drug therapies using advanced computational biology methods.
